# Human-Activity-Recognition
This project focuses on classifying human physical activities (such as walking, sitting, standing, etc.) using sensor data collected from smartphones. Machine learning algorithms are used to train a model that can accurately predict the type of activity based on accelerometer and gyroscope readings.

## ðŸ§  ML Algorithms Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Tree
